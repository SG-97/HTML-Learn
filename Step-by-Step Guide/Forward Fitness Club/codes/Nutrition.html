                <h2 class="articletitle">Meal Prepping</h2>

                  <p>Simply put, meal prep means prepping for meals. And while single-serve meals are the most common approach to meal prep, there are other types to choose from depending on your schedule,
                    tastes, and dietary needs. <br><br>

                    Types of meal prep include:<br><br>
                  </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><span class="articlepoints">Full make-ahead meals:</span> You cook an entire meal and store it in your fridge or freezer.<br><br></li>
                            <li><span class="articlepoints">Batch cooking or freezing:</span> Make multiple meals, then portion and store them. This approach is useful for recipes you can easily cook in large amounts
                                    (like big pots of soup, rice, or mashed sweet potatoes).<br><br></li>
                            <li><span class="articlepoints">Meals for one:</span> Prepare food and portion it in single-serving containers. (Usually enough to last a few days.)<br><br></li>
                            <li><span class="articlepoints">Ingredient prep:</span> For people who like to cook and serve food all at once, just prep parts of recipes. Chop veggies, mix spices, or marinade meat
                                    in advance to save time when you’re ready to cook.<br><br></li>
                        </ul>

                <h2 class="articletitle">Discpline</h2>

                <p> Discpline is the ability to do what you need to do, EVEN WHEN YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE DOING IT. There are things you can do to learn self-discipline and gain the willpower to live a happier life. <br><br>

                      If you are looking to take control of your habits and choices, here are the FIVE most powerful things you can do to master self-discipline:<br><br>
                </p>

                      <ul>
                            <li><span class="articlepoints">Know your weaknesses:</span> We all have weaknesses. Whether they’re snacks like potato chips or chocolate chip cookies, or technology like Facebook or the latest addictive game app,
                                    they have similar effects on us.Acknowledge your shortcomings, whatever they may be. Too often people either try to pretend their vulnerabilities don’t exist or cover up any pitfalls in their lives.
                                      Own up to your flaws. You can’t overcome them until you do.<br><br></li>
                            <li><span class="articlepoints">Remove temptations:</span> If you want to eat healthier, toss the junk food in the trash.The fewer distractions you have, the more focused you will be on accomplishing your goals. Set yourself up for
                                    success by ditching bad influences.<br><br></li>
                            <li><span class="articlepoints">Set clear goals and have an execution plan:</span> A clear plan outlines each step you must take in order to reach your goals. Figure out who you are and what you are about. Create a mantra to keep
                                    yourself focused. Successful people use this technique to stay on track and establish a clear finish line.<br><br></li>
                            <li><span class="articlepoints">Create new habits by keeping it simple:</span> Acquiring self-discipline and working to instill a new habit can feel daunting at first, especially if you focus on the entire task at hand. To avoid
                                    feeling intimidated, keep it simple. Break your goal into small, doable steps. Instead of trying to change everything at once, focus on doing one thing consistently and master self-discipline
                                      with that goal in mind. If you’re trying to get in shape, start by working out 10 or 15 minutes a day. If you’re trying to achieve better sleep habits, start by going to bed 15 minutes earlier each
                                        night. If you want to eat healthier, start by prepping a bag lunch the night before to take with you in the morning. Take baby steps. Eventually, when you’re ready, you can add more
                                          goals to your list.<br><br></li>
                            <li><span class="articlepoints">Give yourself a backup plan:</span> Before you go, tell yourself that instead of diving into a plate of cheese and crackers, you will sip a glass of water and focus on mingling. Going in with
                                    a plan will help give you the mindset and the self-control necessary for the situation. You will also save energy by not having to make a sudden decision based on your emotional state.<br><br></li>
