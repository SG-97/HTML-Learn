p1:

    Good nutrition is a lifestyle, not a diet. It starts with a new way of thinking about food. Think of your body as a vehicle that uses food for fuel. Fill your tank with the right type of fuel.


p2:

    Do not approach your nutrition plan as a diet plan, but rather, a lifestyle change. If you make a permanent change, you will see big results. The key to success is a daily focus on your goal.

p3:

    Portion your meals and track your calories. There are many free mobile apps available to help track your calories and activity level.

p4:

    Control your impulsive urges to buy "junk food" , and instead, allow yourself to one "cheat meal" a week.
